# Personalized Cancer Medicine 
 The aim of this project it to classifying the given genetic mutations based on the literature available in the medical domain into one of the given 9 classes.
A lot has been said during the past several years about how precision medicine and, more concretely, how genetic testing is going to disrupt the way diseases like cancer are treated.
But this is only partially happening due to the huge amount of manual work still required. In this project, we look to take personalized medicine to its full potential.
Once sequenced, a cancer tumor can have thousands of genetic mutations. But the challenge is distinguishing the mutations that contribute to tumor growth (drivers) from the neutral mutations (passengers).
Currently, this interpretation of genetic mutations is being done manually. This is a very time-consuming task where a clinical pathologist has to manually review and classify every single genetic mutation based on evidence from text-based clinical literature. The machine learning solution to this problem will help to speed up this time-consuming procedure and produce results with significant accuracy.
This project creates features out of medical literature data and develops a machine learning algorithm that, using this knowledge base as a baseline, automatically classifies genetic variations.
It experiments with different models such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, KNN, and Naive Bayes to find the best-fitting model for the problem statement.
